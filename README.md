# duck-height-counter
## Test task for RAS Tech Summer

###Task:
The data is N rubber ducks to be stacked in a row.
Each duck has a specific height and width. 
We need to arrange the ducks in such a way that the sum of the heights of the ducks used
was as large as possible, and their total width did not exceed the maximum row width.
Input: The first line of standard input contains two integers N, M (1 <= N, M <= 50),
separated by single intervals denoting respectively: the number of ducks available
and the maximum line width. Each subsequent line N contains two integers w, s (1 <= w, s <=9),
separated by a single spacing indicating the height (w) and width (s) of the duck output:
Your program must print to stdout the maximum available sum of the heights of the ducks used to line them up.
